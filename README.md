This repository contains the content regarding Project 2 for MATH237.
The goal of this notebook was to use a multivaraite classification to predict whether individuals have one of the five classes in the Mental Health Condition feature, which included: Anxiety, PTSD, Depression, Bipolar, and NaN (Which is none of the conditions). Two models were used, SVC (Support Vector Classifier) model, and Random Forest model as a more complex model. In order to train and test this multiclassification model, 12 features below were used from the 'Mental_Health_Lifestyle_Dataset'
